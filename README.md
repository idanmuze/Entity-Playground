FPS template for Godot to give starter content for a new or already existing project!

#### One-Liner

Entity-Playground can take in two JSON-defined entities with one personality trait and generate a unique, engaging conversation between the two in real-time or as a JSON export ready to be consumed by other applications.

#### Intended Uses

Most games have laughably unintelligent NPCs. While this can be entertaining, games that seek to achieve unprecedented immersion, MMOs, for example, can’t afford this. Some game design studies have shown that merely giving the appearance of intelligence to NPCs (and enemies) can disproportionately immerse players. One example of this is how much more intelligent the player base perceives enemy units to be in HALO when merely the aggression values are increased. Entity-playground’s goal is to help reproduce this with an entire suite of quasi-intelligence tools that avoid or minimize the hassle of Artificial-Intelligence libraries. Designers should not have to suffer from the frustrating binary of hyperintelligent-Tensorflow-models vs bumbling, 2000s-era bots.
